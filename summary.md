# How do I write a script for a web page?
## Before start to learn the JavaScript language, you need to know how it will fit together with the HTML and CSS in your web pages. 
### JavaScript is written in plain text, just like HTML and CSS, so you do not need any new tools to write a script. This example adds a greeting into an HTML page. The greeting changes depending on the time of day.
### When you want to use JavaScript with a web page, you use the HTML `<script>` element to tell the browser it is coming across a script. Its s re attribute tells people where the JavaScript file is stored. 
### You may see JavaScript in the HTML between opening `<script>` and closing `</script>` tags (but it is better to put scripts in their own files). 
## How can I write a secript for a web page?
1- It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file.JavaScript files are text files(like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets),but they have the .js extension. 
2- The HTML `<script>` element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the `<link>` element can be used to load a *CSS* file). 
3- If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the *JavaScript* will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.
